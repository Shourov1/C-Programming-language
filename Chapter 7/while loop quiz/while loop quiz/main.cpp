//Write a program that prints out the letters a through z along with their ASCII codes. Hint: to print characters as integers, you have to use a static_cast.

/*
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char mychar = 'a';
    while (mychar <= 'z')
    {
        std::cout << mychar  << " " << static_cast<int>(mychar) << "\n";

3) Invert the nested loops example so it prints the following:

5 4 3 2 1
4 3 2 1
3 2 1
2 1
1
*/

/*
#include <iostream>

// Loop between 5 and 1
int main()

        std::cout << "\n";

/*
 4) Now make the numbers print like this:
 
         1
       2 1
     3 2 1
   4 3 2 1
 5 4 3 2 1
